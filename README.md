# main.py
    
    This project is about learning how to use APIs and web scrapping, in my case I used The Movie Database API. Which gives me information about movies. 

# create_df.py

    The user write a list of movies, then a dataset is printed with information about this movies, additionally a .csv is created with this dataset.

Then the code has some commands to manipulate the data in the dataset and printed it in the console.

# data_manipulation.py
    Functions in this file are used to manipulate data in the dataset.
