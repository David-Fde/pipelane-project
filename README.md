# pipelane-project

This project is about learning how to use APIs and web scrapping, in my case I used The Movie Database API. Which gives me information about movies. 

My code works as follows: the user write a list of movies and I print a dataset with information about this movies, additionally I create a .csv file with this dataset.

Then the code has some commands to manipulate the data in the dataset and printed it in the console.

The data_manipulation.py file is used to manipulate data locally, this is faster than manipulate them in the main.py file.
